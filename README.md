# Public-Domain-Mark (worldwide status unknown)
Creating a new public domain mark that can be used when worldwide public domain status is unknown but public domain status in at least one jurisdiction is known, in collaboration with Europeana, DPLA and CC affiliates; and if determined to be desirable, finalizing and publishing the new tool. 

This project also involves ongoing work and consultation with DPLA and Europeana on RightsStatements.org, the development of its governance structure, and the undelying technology infrastructure that powers the standard rights statements that will be published.
